# Zabbix Problem Reports Automation Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a system that automates the generation of problem reports in Zabbix, a network and infrastructure monitoring platform. The system will use the Zabbix API to access information about current problems and generate detailed reports for the operations team.

## Key Features

1. **Zabbix API Integration**: The system will connect to the Zabbix API to retrieve information about current problems.

2. **Report Generation**: Based on the collected information, the system will generate detailed reports that include data on the problems, their causes, impact, and possible solutions.

3. **Report Scheduling**: Reports can be scheduled to be generated automatically at specific intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

4. **Report Customization**: Users can customize the content and format of the reports according to their needs.

5. **Notifications**: The system can send notifications via email or other communication channels when new reports are ready.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- API Framework: Flask
- HTTP Requests Library: Requests
